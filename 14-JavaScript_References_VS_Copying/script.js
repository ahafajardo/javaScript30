// Let's say we have an array

// You might think we can just do something like this:
const playersCopy1 = players;
// however what happens when we update that array?
playersCopy1[0] = "West";
// now here is the problem!
console.log({ players }, { playersCopy1 });
// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

// one way
const playersCopy2 = players.slice();
playersCopy2[1] = "South";

// or create a new array and concat the old one in
const playersCopy3 = [].concat(players);

// or use the new ES6 Spread
const playersCopy4 = [...players];

//or use Array.from()
const playersCopy5 = Array.from(players);
playersCopy5[0] = "Weston";
console.log({ players }, { playersCopy5 });
// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

// with Objects
const person = {
  name: "Wes Bos",

// and think we make a copy:
const personCopy1 = person;
personCopy1.name = "West Boston";

// how do we take a copy instead?
const personCopy2 = Object.assign({}, person);

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
